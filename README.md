# word_finder
<h1>Information about the program</h1>
<p>This is a word finder program which is written in python. It is a small project. This can help you to find different words from your text. It will be the best if you use it in an online interpreter like here! https://www.online-python.com/ because in copy/pasting, this program might be automatically close in your local computer. If you want to write text than it will be the best program which you can use on your local computer</p>
